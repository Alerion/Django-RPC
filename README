This project contain jQuery version of ExtJs Rpc module - Ext.Direct. 
It contains some code from ExtJs Core.

It can do almost the same, except file uploading. Simple form can be sent
with patched version of jquery.form widget.

And I make few modification for simple code. Not you should not send number of 
arguments and flag of from handler.

And you can find Python module for Django to create server-side for RPC.

This project contain few pages with demo. And the best documentation for now is
these demo pages and source code of main application. 

If your are familiar with Python you can learn a lot from utils.rpc.py
